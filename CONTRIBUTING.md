## Reporting issues

If you have found what you think is a bug in one or many of the utilities, please [file an issue](https://github.com/ivanatias/ezreact/issues).

## Suggesting ideas

If you are here to suggest a new utility, or to suggest an improvement for an existing one, first create an issue if it does not already exist. From there, we will discuss use-cases for the new utility and then finally discuss how it could be best implemented.

- Install dependencies using `pnpm install`
- For creating new utilities or modifying existing ones, navigate into `packages/main`.
