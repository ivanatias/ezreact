# EzReact - React Hooks and Components that you can copy and paste in your projects

EzReact is a collection of carefully crafted, performant, and well-tested React utilities (components and hooks) that you can copy and paste in your projects to streamline your development process of React applications. JavaScript and TypeScript code is available for each utility.

These utilities were written with the following ideas in mind:

- Reliability
- Performance
- SSR compatibility
- Ease to use

## Structure

This repository consists of 3 main parts:

- `packages/main`: 
This is the core of the project, built with Vite. It contains all the utility components and hooks, along with their tests.

- `packages/cli`: 
This package contains the code for the Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI is designed to simplify the usage of the hooks and components, allowing you to easily integrate them into your projects without the hassle of copying and pasting directly from the documentation site.

- `packages/docs`: 
Hosts the documentation site for both the utilities and the CLI. Here, you can find detailed guides on how to use each utility, examples, and API references to help you get started quickly and effectively.
